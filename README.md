# Study and Comparing Oscillations and Waves in Electron and Ion Plasmas
The goal of this work is to provide an interactive way for the user to study the formation of waves and oscillations in plasma once a perturbation, that results in the displacement of charged particle in the plasma, is applied. Specifically, we look at electron and ion plasmas that are not in a magnetic field.

**Steps to Run this file**: 

1.   Download file (will be as an .ipynb file)
2.   Install Jupyter Notebook if not already downloaded
3.   Open Jupyter Notebook and click on the downloaded file.
4.   To run all the cells at once, click on 'Cell' at the top of the notebook. Then Click on 'Run all'.
5.   To run only one cell, click on the cell you want to run (there should be a green boundary around cell). Then click on the 'Run' 
       button at the top of notebook (this will be located just below the 'Cell' option)

6. **(IMPORTANT)** A lot of the resulting plots are interactive. These plots having the following characterisitcs: 

    - a slider by which the user can set/change certain parameters
    - a button that plots the graph with the values for the parameters set by the user 
           
          In order to run and explore the resulting plots with different values, do the following
            1.   Move the sliders for the parameters to whatever values you wish.
            2.   Click the "Run Interact" button.
            3.   You can create a new plot as many times as you wish. Simply move the slider to the
                 new values and then click the "Run Interact button" once again.
